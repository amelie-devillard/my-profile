				<li> I love <strong>music</strong>. I don't have any favorite type of music, I'm very open-minded and I like music from all generations.</li>

		<h2>Future projects</h2>

				<li> <strong>Go around the world :</strong>My father is always talking about his trip all around the world and that makes me dream because I love tranvelling and ventures. I hope I could one day do the same with my friends.</li>

				<li> Do a <strong>humanitarian project</strong> in countries where they need help. I recently applied for a humanitarian association in my school that build project to go on a humanitarian mission. That would be a great opportunity, so I hope they will accept my application. </li>
